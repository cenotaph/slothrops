  %h2 Analogue Music at Slothrop's
  %p
    Slothrop's is pleased to stock a small, carefully chosen selection of music on analogue formats. These records - a mix of secondhand rarities and new, direct-from-artist gems - are selected to increase the presence of vinyl and cassettes in the ever-digital Tallinn marketplace.
  %p
    While we are not primarily a record store, we wish to provide a marketplace for true music aficionados. You won't find any Soviet/Melodia junk here, nor old, beat-up ghosts from the dustbins of history. Instead we are pleased to carry an assortment of oddities for the serious fan of all of music's many avenues and crevices.
